----------------

This project implements a LSM enforcing CWLite policy. The sample LSM implementation is tested with Linux kernel version 2.6.23.

Compilation:
Place the sample.c and Makefile in the <linux-2.6.23 source>/security/ directory.
Build the kernel and sample LSM

Run sample LSM from security directory: sudo insmod sample.ko
Check module loading: lsmod | grep sample
Unload module: sudo rmmod sample

Testing:
Assign labeles "trusted", "untrusted", "ignore" to processes and files: setfattr -n security.sample -v <label> <file/process>

Test code in the test directory.
Files marked "trusted" while testing: [$ ./user_test trfile trfile]
1) user_test (test binary)
2) trfile
- Logged at log_trusted.txt
- Expected log : Allowed with both CWL ON and OFF

Files marked "untrusted" while testing: [$ ./user_test utrfile utrfile]
1) utrfile
- Logged at log_untrusted.txt
- Expected log : Allowed with CWL ON and blocked with CWL OFF
